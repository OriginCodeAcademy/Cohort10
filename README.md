## What to do when you get stuck

It's normal to get stuck while working on assignments. How to get unstuck is one of the most important skills you can learn as a software developer.

Here is a suggested happy path when you are stuck.

- Try to research the problem first. Take a break from coding and spend time researching your problem in the following places:
	- Documentation: Try to find the documentation for the technology you are using, such as the [Angular docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api) for Angular and the [MSDN documentation library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kx37x362.aspx) for C#/.NET.
	- StackOverflow: It's likely that somebody else has had the same problem as you, and had it resolved thanks to the community at Stack Overflow. You should favor accepted answers from users with a high reputation score where possible.
	- Google: The shotgun approach - practice your Google-Fu. For errors, try pasting the exact error into Google. You'll usually find blog posts/stack overflow answers as a result.
- If you didn't find your answer this way, feel free to ask me or your fellow students for help!
- You can reach me on Slack (@cameronwilby) or via email (cameron@origincodeacademy.com).

Let's do this!

Cheers,
