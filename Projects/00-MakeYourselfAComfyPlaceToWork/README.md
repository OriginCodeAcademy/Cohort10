# Day 1 - Welcome to Origin!

> *The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable.*<br />
> **Robert Henri**

First of all - welcome to Origin Code Academy and congratulations for taking an amazing first step toward a successful career in Software Development!

Today will not be heavy on learning new coding topics, instead we will be focusing on one of the most crucial components of being a happy and successful software developer..

> Make yourself a comfortable place to work.

Today is about ensuring that you are prepared for the next 12 weeks of learning. The goal is to remove as much friction as possible so that you can focus on the course instead of any obstacles that could have been avoided day one.

### Hardware Setup
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

You will be spending a lot of time working on the computer in the next 12 weeks, and it's important that you spend that time as productively as possible. Slow computers mean slow learning, so this is a great opportunity to gain back valuable hours in the day that would otherwise be spent waiting for your computer to catch up with you.

The best thing you can do to speed up your computer is to buy and install a Solid State Drive (or SSD) to replace the existing Hard Disk Drive (or HDD) in your computer. For a rundown of the difference between the two and why an SSD provides such a dramatic performance boost - check out the following article. https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hdd-versus-ssd-whats-the-diff/

**Tasks**

- [ ] Ask your instructor to review your hardware.
