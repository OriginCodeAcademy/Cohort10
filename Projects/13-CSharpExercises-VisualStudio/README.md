# C# Exercises

In this assignment, you will continue practicing the fundamentals of C# using a pre-fabricated Visual Studio Solution.

In this solution you will find a file named `Exercises.cs` with a list of exercises to be completed, and a set of tests to pass in `Program.cs`.

The goal of the assignment is to get you familiar with C# and working with Visual Studio, and to make all of the specified tests pass.

3. Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine, once it's installed make sure you install the [software from Day 1](../00-MakeYourselfAComfyPlaceToWork/README.md).
